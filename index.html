  <pre class="ex1">
    The International Space Station (ISS) has been a staple of humanity’s great achievements for nearly 30 years, however it is also the most expensive at an estimated $150 billion. 
    Meant only to last 15 years, it has been called into question as to why it is still being maintained at nearly $3 billion per year. Many plans for its decommissioning have been put forward, 
    and in 2022 NASA finally decided on a course of action: a controlled re-entry. In simple terms, it means carefully pushing the ISS into a collision course with Earth via a booster rocket. 
    A large amount of it will burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, while larger parts will land in a predetermined location, most likely in the Pacific Ocean. 
    This is not the end for human occupied space stations however, as multiple plans have been put forward for newer stations, with one station already in use.

    <u><b>Beginnings and life in orbit</b></u>
    The ISS began life during the cold war collaboration between the USA and USSR. Both wanted a manned space station, yet neither had the funds to complete it on their own. 
    As such, in November 1998 the first module of the ISS was launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Two years later, the first humans went aboard the space station. 
    The European Space Agency, Japan and Canada also aided in constructing the ISS. 

    The station proved invaluable to the scientific community due to its constant near zero gravity, a feat impossible on Earth. 
    LEO allowed for shorter journeys between Earth and the station, while also helping to burn up micrometeorites and debris, thus helping protect the station. 
    LEO also comes with downsides such as orbital decay and aggressive temperature cycling, reducing the station’s lifespan. Upgrades and replacements continue, 
    but NASA chose decommissioning in 2022.

    <u><b>How to “decommission” a space station</b></u>
    Decommissioning the ISS is no easy task. At 109m long and 430 tonnes, many proposals were considered. The station cannot be left in orbit, as without boosts it would 
    eventually crash unpredictably. Raising the orbit was considered but requires extreme fuel. Dismantling and returning parts to Earth was also ruled out.

    NASA ultimately selected a controlled re-entry, targeting Point Nemo in 2030 using a SpaceX-built Deorbit Vehicle.

    <u><b>Legacy and the future of human presence in space</b></u>
    The idea of a manned space station continues. China’s Tiangong station is operational, and NASA has contracted Axiom Space for a new commercial station planned for 2028.
    In 2013 Jeff Bezos recovered Apollo-era Saturn V engines from the Pacific Ocean — suggesting the ISS may also be recoverable in part.
